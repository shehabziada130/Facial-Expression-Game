# Face Expression Recognition using CNN and Transfer Learning

This repository contains the implementation of various Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models and Transfer Learning techniques for Face Expression Recognition (FER) using different datasets.

## Project Structure

- `datasets/`: Contains the datasets used for training and testing the models.
- `models/`: Saved models after training.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration and model training.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for training and evaluating the models.
- `tests/`: Test images used for evaluating the trained models.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.

## Datasets Used

1. **FER 2013 Dataset**: Contains facial expressions labeled into 7 categories (anger, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, sad, surprise).
2. **AffectNet Dataset**: Contains facial expressions labeled into 3 categories (happy, neutral, not happy).
3. **AffectNet Full Expressions Dataset**: Contains facial expressions labeled into 8 categories (anger, contempt, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, sad, surprise).

## Models Implemented

1. **CNN Model for FER 2013**: Basic CNN model for recognizing 7 expressions.
2. **MobileNet Model for AffectNet Dataset**: Transfer learning using MobileNet for recognizing 3 expressions.
3. **Custom CNN Model for AffectNet Full Expressions Dataset**: CNN model for recognizing 8 expressions.
4. **ResNet50 Model for AffectNet Full Expressions Dataset**: Transfer learning using ResNet50 for recognizing 8 expressions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Training Models

1. **CNN Model for FER 2013**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/train_cnn_fer.py
   ```

2. **MobileNet Model for AffectNet Dataset**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/train_mobilenet_affectnet.py
   ```

3. **Custom CNN Model for AffectNet Full Expressions Dataset**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/train_custom_cnn_affectnet.py
   ```

4. **ResNet50 Model for AffectNet Full Expressions Dataset**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/train_resnet50_affectnet.py
   ```

### Evaluating Models

For evaluating any trained model, use the corresponding test script in `scripts/`.

### Predicting from Saved Models

1. Load a saved model:
   ```python
   from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model

   model = load_model('models/model_name.h5')
   ```

2. Use the loaded model for predictions:
   ```python
   # Example: predicting from an image
   import cv2
   import numpy as np

   img = cv2.imread('path/to/test_image.jpg')
   resized_img = cv2.resize(img, (128, 128))
   normalized_img = resized_img / 255.0
   input_data = np.expand_dims(normalized_img, axis=0)

   predictions = model.predict(input_data)
   ```
